# Bamazon_MySQL

Bamazon_MySQL is a CLI app that works on three levels:

* A MySQL database called "bamazon" that has a table called "products", that can be accessed [through this link] (https://github.com/BSG-1/Bamazon_MySQL/blob/master/Images/Bamazon%20Database%20(MySQL).png)

* A **Customer** view, accessed by the terminal command **node bamazonCustomer.js**
    - this shows a customer view of a [failure to purchase] due to an insufficient supply (https://github.com/BSG-1/Bamazon_MySQL/blob/master/Images/Customer%20View%20(failure%20to%20purchase).png)
    - and a customer view of a [successful purchase] (https://github.com/BSG-1/Bamazon_MySQL/blob/master/Images/Customer%20View%20(successful%20purchase).png)

* A **Manager** view, accessed by the terminal command **node bamazonManager.js**
    - this shows a managerial view with [four different options and operations] (https://github.com/BSG-1/Bamazon_MySQL/blob/master/Images/Manager%20View%201%20(default).png)
    - the first option shows [all available inventory in the database] (https://github.com/BSG-1/Bamazon_MySQL/blob/master/Images/Manager%20View%202%20(all%20inventory).png)
    - the second option displays low inventory, more specifically [all product items below 100 units] (https://github.com/BSG-1/Bamazon_MySQL/blob/master/Images/Manager%20View%203%20(low%20inventory).png)
    - the third managerial option allows a manager to [add more units to a low inventory product] (https://github.com/BSG-1/Bamazon_MySQL/blob/master/Images/Manager%20View%204%20(add%20to%20inventory).png)
    - the last managerial option allows the manager to add a new product, with the [CLI prompting the manager specific questions about the product] (https://github.com/BSG-1/Bamazon_MySQL/blob/master/Images/Manager%20View%204%20(add%20to%20inventory).png)
